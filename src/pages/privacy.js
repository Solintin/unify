                We implement a variety of reasonable security measures to
                protect the security and integrity of your personal information.
                We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data
                encryption, enforce physical access to our buildings and files
                and only authorize access to personal information to only
                employees who require the data to fulfil their job

                Accordingly, we are not responsible for matters, which include
                actions of hackers and other unauthorized third parties that
                attempt to breach our reasonable security procedures. No method
                of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, therefore,
                we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal
                Information. It is important that you understand that you also
                play a crucial role in protecting your Personal Information.
